Chief Complaint:
acute renal failure; s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
81 Polish speaking F with baseline dementia found down on floor
while visiting husband on [**Name (NI) 10945**]. Daughter was accompanying patient
to visit, and she stepped out of the room and found on floor.
Patient was unable to accurately recall events preceding fall.
Had told daughter that it was too hot in the room. No acute
medical illness. Mental status at baseline per daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] denies headache, visual changes, neck or back pain; no
hip pain. Gait unchanged.

Patient brought to ED. IN ED Head CT negative for acute bleed,
urine and cxr without evidence of infection; Labs revealing for
new renal failure.  Hyperkalemia with K 5.9, no EKG changes;
received 30mg kayexalate.

Upon transfer to the floor via Polish interpretor patient denied
any acute pain; however, interpretor states patient was not
making sense when speaking, though she does appear to have some
degree of awareness, as she showed us photos of her husband and
non-verbally communicated that he was across the street; she was
able to cooperate somewhat with exam and responded appropriately
to "sleep well" in Yiddish.

Reason: evaluate thyroid goiter

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with massive multinodular goiter with thoracic
outlet airway compression on prior CT, syncopized in hospital
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate thyroid goiter
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT OF THE NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2132-12-5**]

HISTORY: 81-year-old woman with known massive multinodular
goiter and airway compression at the thoracic inlet on prior CT,
status post recent syncopal episode; evaluate goiter.

TECHNIQUE: Helical 5-mm axial tomographic sections were obtained
from the aortic arch through mid orbit level, without IV
contrast administration, and viewed in soft tissue, bone and
lung window on the workstation.

FINDINGS: The study is compared with dedicated CT of the trachea
with reconstructions, dated [**2132-8-5**], as well as chest radiographs
dating to [**2122-9-7**]. Again demonstrated is the enormous
multinodular thyroid goiter, which extends continuously from the
level of the left oropharynx to the level of the top of the
aortic arch. This contains numerous calcifications and several
discrete nodules, many somewhat cystic. It markedly displaces
the cervical trachea to the left and markedly compresses and
effaces its right lateral wall. At the level of maximal
compression at the thoracic inlet (roughly the level of the
mid-clavicle) the trachea is slit like and measures 20 mm (AP)
by 4 mm (TRV), (series 2, image 38) on a roughly comparable
section on the [**8-3**] examination (series 2, image 21) it measured
only approximately 2.5 mm in maximal transverse dimension. The
region of maximal narrowing at the thoracic inlet traverses a
roughly 4 cm segment of the upper thoracic trachea with more
normal tracheal contour at contrast caudal to the
sternoclavicular articulation. There are numerous small lymph
node in the anterior and posterior cervical triangles,
bilaterally, not meeting size criteria for pathologic
enlargement, unchanged. The limited included portions of the
lung apices are clear.

IMPRESSION: Enormous multinodular goiter, extending from the
level of the oropharynx to the aortic arch. There is marked
associated tracheal deviation and compression, particularly at
the level of the thoracic inlet, this is no worse than that
demonstrated on the [**8-3**] study. No new site of tracheal
compression is identified.

COMMENT: These findings were discussed with members of the
clinical team by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of the study.

 Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2132-12-6**]

HABITS:  50 pack year smoker, quit one year ago, likes a
drink per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs stable.  General: This is
an alert oriented male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.  Neck:  Well healed
carotid incisional scars.  Chest is clear to auscultation.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally of ankles and
feet.  There are no abdominal aortic aneurysm on palpation of
the abdomen. The femoral pulses are 1+.  The dorsalis pedis
pulses are monophasic bilaterally.  The neurological is
nonfocal except for anxiety.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular
Service on [**2129-3-3**]. Routine labs were obtained.  Plavix load
of 300 mg with aspirin was given and 325 mg of aspirin was
started 24 hours after it.  Intravenous hydration was begun
for anticipated angiography, a Mucomyst protocol.  The
patient was seen by Neurology.  Their neurological exam,
mental status awake, alert and oriented times three.
Language fluent with good comprehension and repetition of the
months of the year backwards accurate.  Can perform simple
calculations.  Construction intact.  No neglect, no frontal
release signs.  Cranial nerves:  Visual fields are intact.
Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are 1 mm and minimally
reactive bilaterally.  Facial sensation is intact.  Right
facial droop with synkinesis.  Hearing is decreased
bilaterally to finger rub.  Palatal elevation is symmetric.
Shoulder shrug, head turning symmetric.  Tongue midline.
Muscle strength is [**4-11**] bilaterally upper and lower
extremities.  Reflexes show biceps 1+ bilaterally, triceps 1+
bilaterally.  Radial reflexes 1+  Paroxysmal atrial
tachycardia reflex is 0, toes are up.  Sensation is decreased
to pinprick in stocking distribution.  Intact to pain, touch
and proprioception.  Coordination:  Finger-to-nose, heel to
tibia and rapid alternating movements are intact.  There is
no rebound.  Gait is normal base.

LABORATORY: Showed a white count of 5.8,hematocrit 40.8,
platelets 231.  Potassium 3.7, BUN 16, creatinine 1.4,
glucose 145.  PT/INR were normal.

Preoperative Duplex of the Carotids demonstrated the right
with minimal plaque, the left is significant wall thickening
but does not appear to be a heterogenous plaque.  On the
right the systolic velocities are 117, 82, 105.  In the
internal carotid, common carotid and external carotid
arteries respectively.  The internal carotid artery to common
carotid artery ratio is 1.4, this is consistent with 40 to
69% stenosis.  On the left the internal carotid artery is
peak systolic velocity over 374/147.  The remainder of the
vessel peak systolic velocities are 69, 65 in the common
carotid and external carotid artery respectively.  The
Internal carotid artery and CC ratio is 5.4, this is
consistent with 80 to 99% stenosis.  There is antegrade flow
via both vertebral arteries.

Head CT showed no acute hemorrhage or infarct.  Repeat
postoperative ultrasound results of the carotids showed left
carotid patent.  The right carotid was with 40% stenosis.
Velocities results were pending at the time of dictation.

On [**3-4**] the patient went to surgery and underwent angioplasty
with stent placement of a single 10x20 mm Smart Stent to the
left internal carotid artery post dilatation with a 6 mm
balloon.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit for continued
monitoring.  Aspirin was begun and Heparin was begun at 800
units per hour with bolus to maintain the PTT between 60 and
80 overnight and maintain a systolic blood pressure equal or
less than 160 systolic.

The patient was admitted to the Neurological SICU for
monitoring.  Postoperatively he was hemodynamically stable.
There were no focal deficits.  Her pressure was well
controlled on Nipride at 0.7 mcgs per kg per minute.  It was
noted the right groin required additional manual pressure
times 20 minutes.  Heparin was held times one hour and then
restarted at 600 units.  Cardiac enzymes were obtained which
showed a total CPK of 130 and a Troponin of less than .30
which were normal.  The electrocardiogram was without
ischemic changes.  The patient''s groin hematoma remained
stable.  Ambulation was begun but was difficulty secondary to
patient''s right foot pain.  He was begun on Indocin for his
pain. He was seen by physical therapy and they felt he was
safe to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg q day for six weeks.
2.  Pravastatin 20 mg q day.
3.  Acetaminophen 325 mg one to two tablets q 4 to 6 hours
    p.r.n. for pain.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg q day.
5.  Diazepam 2 mg to 5 mg q 6 hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Left carotid stenosis, status post angioplasty with
    stent placement.  Stable.
2.  Hypertension controlled.
3.  Right groin hematoma, stable.

In regards to follow-up the patient should be seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3124**] in one month time with Duplex of the carotids done
and should be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in [**Hospital 4695**] Clinic in two
months.

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87 year old
female with a past medical history of hypertension, coronary
artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma,
who was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
from an outside hospital with pneumonia complicated by a
myocardial infarction and sepsis.

The patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**]
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2125-10-3**] with shortness of breath, cough
and pneumonia.  She then had an episode of hypotension in the
Emergency Room and was resuscitated with fluids.  She was
transferred to the floor, where she began complaining about
chest pain.  She had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
at [**Hospital3 3834**], where she received digoxin and
Lopressor.  With that, she became hypotensive again with
systolic blood pressure in the low 70s.

The patient''s electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm
with nonspecific ST changes and a chest x-ray was significant
for a left lower lobe infiltrate.  Her cardiac enzymes were
elevated, with a CPK of 163, MB 12.3, index 7.5 and troponin
4.  An echocardiogram showed mitral regurgitation and left
ventricular ejection fraction of 70%.  The patient was
treated in the Intensive Care Unit with heparin and a
nitroglycerin drip.  She was given ceftriaxone but continued
to be hypotensive and was started on a Dopamine drip.

Swan catheterization was performed as well and showed a
cardiac output of 10 and systolic vascular resistance of 300.
The patient was then transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival here, the patient continued to
be hypotensive and required the use of multiple pressors,
including Dopamine, dobutamine and vasopressin.  Cardiac
enzymes continued to rise.  Her electrocardiogram was
significant for ST depressions in anterior and lateral leads.

The patient''s respiratory status worsened as well.  The
patient was consulted extensively by the Medical Intensive
Care Unit team and refused intubation.  She also voiced her
desire to avoid resuscitation and intubation.  The [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, her daughter [**Name (NI) 14880**], confirmed the
patient''s will.

The patient remained unintubated, on pressors and
antibiotics.  Over the course of the next 24 hours, she
continued to have chest pain and shortness of breath and was
made "Comfort Measures Only" per her and her family''s
request.  Since [**2125-10-6**], the patient remained on
antibiotics, off pressors and on a morphine sulfate drip for
comfort.  She remained hypotensive over her course of stay in
the hospital.

DISPOSITION:  On [**2125-10-7**] at 1:15 p.m., the patient
had a cardiac arrest and died.  The chief cause of death was
a myocardial infarction and immediate cause was cardiac
arrest.  Time of death was 1:20 p.m. on [**2125-10-7**].

Pertinent Results:
CT Head (report not available): shows bilateral SDH with right
significantly greater than left.  There is right sided uncal
herniation causing compression of the brainstem.  There is also
a
left sided depressed skull fracture along the lower left
temporal
region. 13.6 mm shift right to left.  Complete effacement of
right lateral ventricle.  Complete effacement of fourth
ventricle.  Also appears to have some intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
of left temporal region.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo male with unknown PMH who sustained a fall
with subsequent traumatic head injury resulting in large right
Subdural hemorrhage, significant shift, uncal herniation.  Also
smaller left sided SDH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, left
temporal fracture, facial trauma, and small hemothorax.  On
exam,
patient unresponsive with pupils fixed and dilated.  No change
in
pupillary size or reflex 30 minutes after administration of 100
grams Mannitol.  After thorough evaluation, it is apparent that
intervention here would be medically futile and would not result
in a favorable outcome.

Patient was admitted to Neurosurg in Trauma ICU. No further
Mannitol was given after the 100gm bolus. She was given NS at 75
cc/hour. The organ bank was notified. All supportive meausures
were continued until the family arrived.

In addition to his brain injury, the patient had a large
hemothorax which showed up as a "white out" on imaging of the
chest. He required vasopressors for hypotension and was
hemodynamically unstable while in the ICU. He also had atrial
fibrillation. He expired. Cause of death will be determined by
ME.

Service:  Trauma Surgery

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Status post motorcycle crash.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post motorcycle crash, blunt trauma with massive
    liver laceration, probable closed head injury.
2.  Laceration of small bowel mesentery.
3.  Intraoperative death.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 29-year-old
male who reportedly struck a tree with his motorcycle. He was
agonal at the scene and brought by EMS to the emergency
department where extensive resuscitation was performed. The
patient was hypoxic with agonal breathing and was emergently
intubated. Bilateral chest tubes were placed in the emergency
department. He did at some point have a cardiac arrest, and
ATLS protocol was initiated.

The patient was brought emergently to the operating room
after chest x-ray revealed that the right chest tube appeared
to be below the diaphragm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a GCS of 5. He was
confused. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His abdomen was soft and distended. He had a gross deformity
of his right lower extremity.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated in the
trauma bay. He was emergently intubated, and a large bore
access was placed, as were bilateral chest tubes. Given the
fact that the right chest tube appeared to be below the
diaphragm, and the patient was actively coding, he was
resuscitated and brought emergently to the operating room.

Exploratory laparotomy was performed with a repair of a liver
laceration. He also had a laceration of the small bowel
mesentery. The abdomen was packed. He was resuscitated,
massively receiving 15 units of blood in the operating room.
The patient continued to be unstable throughout the procedure
dropping his blood pressure.

We decided to do a transabdominal pericardiotomy to ensure
that there was no tamponade, which there was not. The aorta
was cross-clamped and held to maintain his blood pressure;
however, the patient continued to be intermittently
bradycardic and hypotensive and finally sustained a cardiac
arrest which he could not be resuscitated.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post motorcycle crash with blunt trauma, massive
    liver laceration and probable closed head injury.
2.  Laceration of small bowel mesentery.
3.  Blood loss anemia.
4.  Intraoperative death.

History of Present Illness:
78yo male transferred from OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) after unwitnessed
fall at NH. The patient is a poor historian and does not recall
the incident. Patient is  CT head from OSH negative. No focal
neurologic symptoms. No localizing [**Last Name (un) 68421**] of infection. By
report, the patient had a C6 fracture. According to the
patient''s son, the patient has had multiple falls in the last
1-2 years. Initially, his falls were thought to be related to a
cardiac etiology and "small heart attacks". He is seen by a
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 5503**] who sent him for defibrillator/pacer
placement a few months ago. He has continued to have falls since
then which are usually unwitnessed and thought to be secondary
to generalized weakness. The patient receives hemodialysis on
Mon, Wed, Fri and did receive his dialysis yesterday.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to have extensive DJD of the
cervical spine with resultant cord compression at C4-C7 and a
large lytic lesion in a throacic vertebral body. Pleural
effusion on the left side was noted on CXR.

#. Tachypnea - Patient became acutely tachypneic and hypoxic
upon transfer to the floor. He most likely experienced an
aspiration event related to post-tussive emesis. Other
etiologies include pneumonia versus fluid overload versus
pulmonary embolus. The patient stabilized with suction and a
short period on 100% NRB. His oxygen saturation has been stable
on 2L nasal cannula after this acute event.

CXR ([**2139-9-22**]):
1. Large left pleural effusion with associated opacity presumed
atelectasis.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
.
T-Spine ([**2139-9-22**]):
1. Mild L1 compression fracture of unknown chronicity.
2. 1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body
3. Large left pleural effusion and tiny right pleural effusion.


C-Spine ([**2139-9-22**]):
Extensive degenerative changes with severe spinal cord
compression at multiple levels as described above, presumed
secondary to degenerative changes. Small well corticated osseous
fragment adjacent spinous process of C7 is likely old trauma,
much less likely acute avulsion injury. There is no definite
evidence for fracture.
**Multiple gallstones are seen. There is marked dilatation of
the common bile duct measuring approximately 2.3 cm and a high
density lesion measuring 2.5 cm at the pancreatic head, which
may represent an impacted stone. There is a biliary drain within
the pancreatic head and extending into the duodenum.

Head CT ([**2139-9-22**]):
1. Small bilateral simple fluid attenuation frontal subdural
collections representing hygromas or chronic subdural hematomas.
No acute hemorrhage is identified.
2. 4 cm right cerebellopontine angle cystic structure, likely an
arachnoid cyst.

Liver US ([**2139-9-23**]):
1. Choledocholithiasis causing massive CHD and CBD dilatation,
without intrahepatic duct dilatation. Biliary stent not
identified.
2. Cholelithiasis.

ERCP ([**2139-9-23**]):
1. A previously placed plastic stent was found in the major
papilla. The stent was pulled and sent for cytology.
2. Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from the major
papilla.
3. The CBD appeared dilated to 12 mm.
4. To aid biliary drainage, a 7cm by 10Fr Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary
stent was placed successfully in the CBD.

Echo ([**2139-9-24**]):
Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to fibrosis and
akinesis of the anterior septum, and akinesis of the anterior
free wall and apex.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) E.coli bacteremia. On [**9-22**] Mr. [**Known lastname 68423**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a temp to 104.
Blood cultures were drawn and later grew e.coli in [**1-15**] bottles.
Enterococcus species were found to grow in the following out in
the following week. He had a positive UA and cultures later grew
serratia and VRE. On [**9-23**], patient was dialyzed and
post-dialysis had a blood pressure of 50/P with tachycardia to
140''s. He was started on levo/flagyl soon thereafter switched to
Vanc/Zosyn. Gent was added per ID recs.

The patient was transferred to ICU secondary to hypotension and
T 104.8.  Blood cultures from this day grew e.coli in [**1-15**]
bottles (making it [**3-17**] total).  Antibiotics included vancomycin,
zosyn, and gentamycin. Patient was noted to be dyspnic,
disoriented, and confused. Vitals were T 104.8; BP 90/48; HR
148; RR 24; Sa02 94% RA. Soon thereafter, vancomycin and zosyn
were D/C''ed per ID recs. Gantamicin was maintained, and therapy
will continue for 14 days (initiated [**9-23**]).

He was taken for urgent ERCP on [**9-23**] for presumed cholangitis.
Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from major
papilla. CBD was dilated to 12 mm. A biliary stent was placed.
Old stent was removed and sent for cytology.

In the ICU, he was transiently on pressors for hypotension - on
[**9-24**] dose of levophed was weaned down and off by [**9-25**].  On
transfer AST was 26; ALT 53; Amylase 66; Lipase 17. WBC was
14.4; creatinine was 4.5. Sepsis was improved and gentamycin was
maintained as sole antibiotic therapy. He was transferred to
floor on [**9-25**].

Follow-up blood cultures dran [**9-25**] remained negative for
bacterial growth. As noted, cultures from [**9-22**] later grew
enterococcus species that were sensitive to high dose
gentamicin. Follow-up blood cultures recommended after
gentamicin course has been finished.

2) Biliary duct dilation and stent placement, as per above.
Findings included:
- A previously placed plastic stent was found in the major
papilla. The stent was pulled and sent for cytology.
- Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from the major
papilla.
- The CBD appeared dilated to 12 mm.
- To aid biliary drainage, a 7cm by 10Fr Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary
stent was placed successfully in the CBD.
- LFTs prior to the procedure were elevated [**9-22**] to ALT 79; AST
417 and fell to normal levels following ERCP. Amylase levels
rose slightly in the days following, suggesting mild post-ERCP
pancreatitis.

3. UTI. Urine grew VRE and serratia [**9-23**] as noted previously.
Cultures of [**9-22**] were negative. Surveillance cultures 10/13 and
[**9-30**] proved negative. Foley catheter was D/C''ed without problem
[**9-28**].

4. Mental status. Mr. [**Known lastname 68423**] was oriented to "self." He was
oriented to "[**Location (un) 86**]" or "Hospital" and "[**2133-7-14**]." Toward the
end of his hospital course, he was oriented to "[**Hospital3 **]
Hospital."

5. CAD
Cardiac markers were elevated (0.13, 0.14, 0.08) from admission.
 An echo showed ejection fraction of 20-30 percent. He was not
cathed.  Beta blocker (metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] po) was resumed on
[**9-26**], following transfer from ICU to the floor. Aspirin therapy
was maintained. He was successfully weaned from oxygen 2L by
nasal cannula to room air. Simvastatin (40 mg) was withheld
until discharge.  SaO2 on [**9-29**] p.m. was 100% 2L.

6. Cord compression:
CT spine showed severe spinal cord compression at the C3-4
through C6-7 levels and 1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the
T5 vertebral body.  PSA was elevated.  Concern for metastatic
prostate cancer was raised. In addition, spinal stenosis and
cord compression were noted from C5 to C7. He was asymptomatic
for cord compression at these levels. Neurosurgery consultation
recommended CT myelogram, which was performed [**10-2**] and
confirmed cord compression. No surgical intervention, however,
was warranted.  Outpatient bone scan is recommended.

7. ESRD on HD and fistula clot. Patient''s AV fistula was noted
to be thrombosed. Transplant surgery attempted thrombectomy
resulted in rethrombosis after one hour. AV fistulogram [**9-29**]
revealed aneurysm and impatent AV fistula, and attempted
re-thrombectomy by IR was also unsuccessful. Instead, a right
internal jugular hemodialysis catheter was placed, through which
Mr. [**Known lastname 68423**] has also received his IV gentamicin. Hemodialysis was

documentation) and will be resumed per patient''s usual WMF
routine at the [**Location (un) 5503**] dialysis unit. [**Location (un) 5503**] will also
arrange for further AV fistula surgery.

8. Anemia. Found to be macrocytic with unknown baseline but
stable. Dialysis administered erythropoietin. Please follow-up
with outpatient evaluation.

10. HTN. Following patient''s ICU course, his home dose of
lisinopril 2.5 mg PO daily was reinstated. Due to elevated blood
pressures (160s/80s), the dose was increased to 5 mg daily. He
was discharged with this new dose.

11. Afib. Patient remained in NSR during stay.  On beta-blocker
and ASA.

12. Thrombocytopenia. Platelet count on [**9-25**] was found to be
88. While patient was not receiving heparin, his IV lines were
being flushed with heparin. This was D/C''ed and assay for anti
PF4 antibodies was sent. This later returned negative for HIT.
Platelet counts soon increased to the 180s and remained stable.

13. Other prophylaxis. DVT prophylaxis was maintained with
pneumoboots. Reflux prophylaxis was maintained with protonix.

Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old man with
a history of metastatic prostate carcinoma and diastolic
dysfunction, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2138-3-31**], where
he was admitted for progressive dyspnea.

He presented with right arm pain.  The patient reported that
he had been leaning on the door frame, and slipped and fell
onto his right arm.  The patient was unable to move his arm
and had severe pain, 10 out of 10.

He went to the Emergency Department.  He denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, or increasing edema.

He was seen by the Orthopedic Service and was found to have
displaced distal third of the right humerus.  The patient''s
arm was placed in a sling, and pain was controlled.

The patient denied any numbness or tingling or loss of
sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Prostate cancer in [**2131**] with
metastases to the ribs, high PSA value, treated with hormone
therapy.  2.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic
dysfunction, ejection fraction of 55% and symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  3.  Ostomy status post ileal loop
diversion in [**2132**].  4.  Status post median nerve
decompression.  5.  Exertional dyspnea evaluated by Pulmonary
in [**2137-2-13**], who thought this was secondary to congestive
heart failure.  6.  Obstructive sleep apnea.  7.  Bone marrow
dysfunction.  8.  Anemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prochlorperazine 10 mg q.6 hours
p.r.n. nausea, Naproxen 250-500 mg q.8 hours as needed, Lasix
20 mg p.o. q.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Senna 1 tab b.i.d.,
Dronabinol 2.5 b.i.d. for nausea, Tizanidine 2 mg h.s. for
muscle relaxation, Tramadol 150 mg q.6 hours, Levofloxacin
250 mg q.d., Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from previous
hospitalization.

IMAGES:  X-ray revealed acute fracture in the midshaft of the
right humerus with distal segment angulation medially.

IMPRESSION:  This was a man with metastatic prostate and
diastolic dysfunction who has had a traumatic humeral
fracture.

There was concern that the fracture was due to pathologic
fracture given the presence of bone lesions seen on a bone
scan; however, the lesions were not in the exact region of
the fracture.

The patient was sent to the Operating Room and had a right
humeral open reduction and internal fixation on [**4-7**].

After the procedure, peripheral pulses were intact.  There
was some sensory dysfunction in the ulnar distribution.  This
was monitored postoperatively.

After the operation, the patient had respiratory distress and
hypovolemia and was transferred to the SICU.  This was due to
worsening congestive heart failure.  He was monitored
carefully.  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction, and
he was given careful diuresis.  Hypoxia was worsened by his
history of restrictive lung disease according to past
pulmonary function tests.

The patient required pressor support on Neo-Synephrine.  He
was given frequent intravenous fluid boluses.  He was very
tachycardiac.  This was treated with increasing beta-blockers
to maximize his diastolic filling and optimize cardiac
output.

CVP was found to be low.  The patient was given 1 U packed
red blood cells.  He received BIPAP at night for his
obstructive sleep apnea.

The patient had persistent anemia due to blood loss
postoperatively during his SICU course.  He received a total
of 4 U packed red blood cells.

The patient was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency.  There
was no evidence for sepsis.

Throughout the SICU course, the patient received a large
amount of intravenous fluids and had increasing edema
throughout his body.  The patient was weaned off
Neo-Synephrine and transferred out of the SICU where he was
stable but with low blood pressure, off blood pressure
medications, requiring 2 L nasal cannula.

On the floor, diuresis was continued gently to prevent
hypovolemia.  The patient was slowly started on ACE inhibitor
to maximize cardiac output in the setting of congestive heart
failure.  The patient was then restarted on Metoprolol to
maximize his diastolic filling and lower his heart rate if
possible.

He was seen by Physical Therapy, as well as Occupational
Therapy who recommended rehabilitation.

Across this time, the patient was noted to be
thrombocytopenic, and platelets were stable in the low 60s to
high 50s.  This was discussed with the patient''s oncologist
who reported that the patient had been taking a medication
called Samarian.  .................. causes for platelets to
be low, but there was no cause being Lovenox.

On the day of discharge the patient was ambulating well,
breathing 96% on room air, voiding via Foley, and pain was
fully controlled, even during Physical Therapy.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for
continued management.

The patient was instructed to continue all of his medications
as prescribed and to the Emergency Room if he has increasing
pain, shortness of breath, or hypotension.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Fractured right humerus.
2.  Diastolic dysfunction.
3.  Metastatic prostate cancer.
4.  Aspiration pneumonia.
5.  Status post right open reduction and internal fixation.
6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  Pulmonary edema.
8.  Hypoxia.
9.  Thrombocytopenia.
10. Anemia due to blood loss.
11. Obstructive sleep apnea.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in Oncology on [**4-8**] and to reschedule this.
The patient was instructed to see the ostomy nurse in the
clinic on [**2138-5-15**], and with the podiatrist on [**2138-5-16**].  He was also instructed to see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**] once he
is discharged from [**Hospital1 **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Compazine 10 mg q.6 hours as needed
for nausea, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. for constipation, Dronabinol
2.5 mg b.i.d. for nausea, Tizanidine 2 mg h.s. for muscle
relaxation, Ambien 5 mg h.s. p.r.n. insomnia, Tylenol 500 mg

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1191**] is a 78-year-old woman with history
of rheumatoid arthritis and biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of
the distal esophagus. There was some discordant staging
information with a PET scan and CT scan suggesting disease
confined to the esophagus.  An EUS suggested transmural
involvement. She is otherwise a reasonable candidate for
resection. We felt it important to define her specific
surgical stage before deciding regarding chemotherapy and
radiation. Therefore, a resection was recommended and we
initially planned a transhiatal esophagectomy. This also
would require feeding jejunostomy. Her methotrexate given for
rheumatoid arthritis was held for 10 days preoperatively and
she had a standard mechanical bowel prep. She agreed to proceed.

There is free passage of contrast through the esophagus and the
esophagojejunal anastomotic site with no evidence of leak or
holdup. Contrast flows freely into the more distal small bowel.
A final overhead image performed at the end of the procedure
demonstrates a small amount of contrast in the distal esophagus,
and contrast seen in distal bowel.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of anastomotic leak or holdup of contrast, with free
flow of contrast into the small bowel. Findings were discussed

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted and taken to the OR for esophagectomy for T3 ,
N0 adeno ca of the esophagus. During the surgery cancer was
found at the GE junction and therefore a  distal esophagectomy

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Mitral valve prolapse, coronary artery disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting with the saphenous vein
graft to the left anterior descending artery and to the
first obtuse marginal artery.
2. Mitral valve replacement with a 27 mm [**Doctor First Name 7624**]
pericardial model 2600 valve.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 82-year-old female with a history of dementia who was
noted dyspneic on exertion to the point where she is almost
wheelchair bound. She had work-
up which showed coronary artery disease involving the left
anterior descending artery and the first obtuse marginal artery,
as well as severe mitral regurgitation with valve segments of
the both the anterior and posterior leaflets. She also has
moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

After discussion with the patient and her family, it was felt
that she would benefit from mitral valve replacement, as well as
bypassing the coronary artery stenosis. The risks were explained
to the patient and her family, and they agreed to proceed.

 CHEST, 2 VIEWS, PA AND LATERAL:

 Preop carotid stenosis.

 The heart size is normal.  No evidence for CHF.  There is a focal area of
 pleural density in the left mid zone acute or chronic nature of which is
 uncertain in the absence of prior films for comparison.  No definite
 associated rib lesion.  There is probable biapical scarring.  No free pleural
 effusion.  Surgical clips are present in the right neck.

 IMPRESSION:  Focal area of pleural density in left mid zone, as described.
 Significance and acute/chronic nature undetermined in the absence of prior
 films.  Comparison with prior outside films if available would be helpful.
 Alternatively short term follow up after surgery is suggested to reevaluate
 and determine if there is a need for further workup such as CT scan.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  diagnostic cerebral angiogram.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out right internal carotid artery recurrent
 stenosis following right endarterectomy and rule out left internal carotid
 artery stenosis.

 POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of recurrent stenosis in the right
 internal carotid artery and greater than 90% stenosis at the left internal
 carotid artery site of previous endarterectomy. This stenosis was treated
 using stent angioplasty with no residual stenosis.

 ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care.

 INDICATION: Mr. [**Known lastname 529**] is a 76-year-old man who is status post bilateral
 endarterectomy. Recent follow-up imaging suggested the presence of recurrent
 right internal carotid artery stenosis as well as left internal carotid artery
 restenosis. This angiogram is being performed to confirm these findings and to
 determine the need for endovascular revascularization using stent angioplasty
 for recurrent stenosis following endarterectomy.

 CONSENT: The patient and his family was given a full and complete explanation
 of the procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and
 alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the
 possible complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
 neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
 complications including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The
 patient and his family understood and wished to proceed with the operation.

 PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
 placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
 prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle
 was then used to puncture the right femoral artery, and upon the return of
 brisk arterial blood, a 8 French vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
 and kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
                                                             (Over)

 selectively catheterize the following vessels: aortic arch, right subclavian
 artery, right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left
 common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.

 RESULTS: Injection of the aortic arch revealed no evidence of atherosclerosis
 at the innominate origin, left common carotid artery origin or the left
 subclavian artery origin. The innominate artery is free or atherosclerosis and
 the origin of the subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery are
 also free of significant atherosclerosis. Injection of the right subclavian
 artery revealed the presence of approximately 30% stenosis at the origin of a
 right vertebral artery. This is has a smooth appearance and the right
 vertebral artery is the less dominant of the two. Injection of the right
 common carotid artery shows a normal appearance of a carotid artery
 bifurcation status post patch angioplasty. There is no evidence of stenosis of
 the right internal or external carotid arteries. Following the course of the
 right internal carotid artery intracranially at the high cervical intracranial
 portion of the right internal carotid artery are widely patent with no
 evidence of stenosis. The intracranial portion of the right internal carotid
 artery there harbors no evidence of atherosclerosis or stenosis and it appears
 to meet at the anterior cerebral artery is a dominant A1 resulting in blood
 flow to both A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery bilaterally.
 Injection of the left common carotid artery revealed the presence greater than
 90% focal stenosis consistent with post endarterectomy restenosis. The left
 external carotid artery does not fill from the left common carotid injection
 cannot be visualized. The intenal carotid artery intracranially appears to be
 free of atherosclerotic disease or stenosis and fills mostly the middle
 cerebral artery with some contribution to the left anterior cerebral artery.
 There is no evidence for arteriovenous shunting intracranially. Injection of
 the left subclavian artery reveals it to be free of atherosclerosis at its
 origin and [**Hospital1 3420**] mild intimal atherosclerosis on its lateral aspect, opposite
 the origin of the vertebral artery. The origin of the left vertebral artery is
 free of atherosclerotic disease and injection of the left vertebral artery
 reveals it to have a normal course without evidence of atherosclerotic
 disease. It is the dominant vertebral artery and the vertebral basilar
 junction, basilar trunk and posterior cerebral artery and suprasellar arteries
 are all free of aneurysmal dilatation or focal atherosclerosis. In addition
 injection of the left vetebral artery is seen to provide flow to the anterior
 circulation via a patent left greater than right posterior communicating
 artery.

 ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE: At this point the decision was made following review of
 the findings to proceed with endovasular stent angioplasty of the left
 internal carotid artery post endarterectomy stenosis. To that end the patient
 was administered heparin to achieve an activated clotting time of greater than
 250 seconds. A guidecatheter of size 8 French was inserted coaxially over a 5
 French diagnostic catheter into the left common carotid artery and kept in a
                                                             (Over)

 heparinized saline flush. At this point a permanent angioplasty was performed
 with a 3 mm x 20 cm balloon following which an angiographic run was performed.
 Subsequently and well maintaining the microwire across the stenosis a stent of
 type Smart Precise stent measuring 10 mm x 20 mm was deployed across the
 stenosis. Following deployment of the stent an angiographic run was performed.
 Following the stent deployment in addition a 6 mm x 20 mm Slolum balloon was
 used to perform post deployment angioplasty. The residual stenosis was seen to
 have been resolved in the medial aspect of the superior edge of the stent.
 However it was noticed to flare into an area of expansion of the
 endarterectomy repair. A decision was made against placing an overlapping
 stent since it was felt that there was excellent flow through the stent at
 this point and that this area of would remodel with time. At this point
 angiography was performed over the intracranial region to rule out branch
 occlusion. There was no evidence of distal branch embolus or any slow flow in
 the intracranial vessels. In addition the patient was examined was noted to be
 neurologically at baseline. At this point the guidecatheter was withdrawn from
 the patient along with the microwire and the sheath was kept on a heparinized
 saline flush and the patient transferred to the intensive care unit in stable
 condition.

 IMPRESSION: No evidence of restenosis in the right carotid endarterectomy site
 or distal right internal  carotid artery. Focal restenosis to 90% on the left
 internal carotid artery endarterectomy teated successfully using stent
 angioplasty.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON:  Known carotid stenosis.  Perform evaluation.

 FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  On the
 right minimal plaque is identified.  On the left there is significant wall
 thickening, but there does not appear to be heterogeneous plaque.

 On the right peak systolic velocities are 117, 82, 105 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
 respectively.  The ICA:CCA ratio is 1.4.  This is consistent with 40-69%
 stenosis.

 On the left in the internal carotid artery the peak systolic velocity over
 diastolic velocity is 374/147.  In the remainder of the vessel peak systolic
 velocities are 69, 65, in the CCA, ECA respectively.  ICA:CCA ratio is 5.4.
 This is consistent with 80-99% stenosis.

 There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

 IMPRESSION:  On the left there is an 80-99% carotid stenosis that appears to
 be most likely due to intimal hyperplasia status post endarterectomy.  On the
 right there is 40-59% carotid stenosis.

 INDICATION: 75 year old man, status post stent placement for a severe focal
 stenosis in the preterminal portion of the left common carotid artery, three
 days ago.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color Doppler and spectral Doppler
 examinations were performed at the level of the cervical portions of the
 bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.

 On the right side, there is no significant change as compared to the
 examination performed three days ago, with absence of significant carotid
 artery stenosis.

 On the left side, the stent is visualized at the level of the upper portion of
 the left common carotid artery, with mild and irregular, hourglass-like,
 narrowing in its mid portion, similar to that observed on the angiographic
 images at the end of the stenting procedure. There is good color filling of
 the lumen, and the peak systolic velocities in the internal, common and
 external carotid arteries are 99, 38 and 44 cm/second, respectively. This
 gives a left ICA to CCA velocity ratio of 2.6.

 CONCLUSION: Mild, non-hemodynamically significant residual stenosis post
 recent stenting of the upper portion of the left common carotid artery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2132-12-5**]

 HISTORY:  81-year-old woman with known massive multinodular goiter and airway
 compression at the thoracic inlet on prior CT, status post recent syncopal
 episode; evaluate goiter.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical 5-mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 aortic arch through mid orbit level, without IV contrast administration, and
 viewed in soft tissue, bone and lung window on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  The study is compared with dedicated CT of the trachea with
 reconstructions, dated [**2132-8-5**], as well as chest radiographs dating to [**2122-9-7**].
 Again demonstrated is the enormous multinodular thyroid goiter, which extends
 uninterrupted from the level of the left oropharynx to the level of the
 superior aortic arch.  This contains numerous calcifications and several
 discrete nodules, many somewhat cystic.  It markedly displaces the cervical
 trachea to the left and markedly compresses and effaces its right lateral
 wall.  At the level of maximal compression at the thoracic inlet (roughly the
 level of the mid-clavicle) the trachea is slit-like and measures 20 mm (AP) by
 4 mm (TRV), (series 2, image 38); on a roughly comparable section on the [**8-3**]
 examination (series 2, image 21) it measured only approximately 2.5 mm in
 maximal transverse dimension.  The region of maximal narrowing at the thoracic
 inlet traverses a roughly 4 cm segment of the upper thoracic trachea with more
 normal tracheal contour,  caudal to the sternoclavicular articulation.  There
 are numerous small lymph node in the anterior and posterior cervical
 triangles, bilaterally, not meeting size criteria for pathologic enlargement,
 unchanged.  The limited included portions of the lung apices are clear.

 IMPRESSION:  Enormous multinodular goiter, extending from the level of the
 oropharynx to the aortic arch.  There is marked associated tracheal deviation
 and compression, particularly at the level of the thoracic inlet, this is no
 worse than that demonstrated on the [**8-3**] study.  No new site of tracheal
 compression is identified.

 COMMENT:  These findings were discussed with members of the clinical team by
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1079**] at the time of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  81-year-old with massive toxic multinodular goiter causing
 tracheal compression, now with syncope.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest with 5 mm collimation performed without
 the administration of IV contrast.

 Comparison is made to neck CT performed the same day and tracheal CT performed
 [**2132-8-5**].

 FINDINGS:  There is a massive heterogeneous thyroid goiter with coarse
 calcifications, which when compared to the concurrent neck CT is seen to
 extend superiorly from the level of the hypopharynx into the mediastinum.
 Leftward tracheal deviation and compression begins 1 cm below the vocal cords,
 and is most severe approximately 2-3 cm below the vocal cords where the
 internal diameters are 19 x 2 mm. This is slightly more narrowed than on the
 prior trachea CT when the minimum diameter was 3 mm, but on the concurrent
 neck CT, the diameter is 4 mm at the same level, suggesting a component of
 tracheomalacia. The goiter at this level measures at least 6.1 x 6.7 cm.
 Tracheal deviation and narrowing extends approximately 8 cm below the vocal
 cords into the mediastinum to the level of the aortic arch. The distal trachea
 and the bronchi are normal.

 Minor atelectasis is seen in the lower lobes.  There is no nodule, pleural
 effusion, or pathologic lymphadenopathy.  Several calcified pretracheal and
 subcarinal lymph nodes are seen.  The heart is mildly enlarged, particularly
 the left atrium.  The right pulmonary artery is dilated measuring 3.5 cm.
 Coronary calcifications are present.

 There is small hiatal hernia.  Hypodensities are seen in the liver consistent
 with cysts.  A 3 mm hypodensity seen in the left lobe near the dome is too
 small to characterize.  Cortical atrophy is seen in the interpolar region of
 the left kidney.  There is focal contour abnormality and slight increase in
 cortical attenuation in the anterior interpolar region of the right kidney.
 Comparison with abdominal CT performed [**2128-9-20**] demonstrates a cyst
 in this area.  A small splenule is present.

 Soft tissues are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
 thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 INDICATION:  78-year-old with esophageal cancer post-distal esophagectomy,
 total gastrectomy, and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy.  Assess for patency of
 anastomosis and leak.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single contrast esophagogram initially with Gastrografin, followed
 by thin barium.

 FINDINGS:  An initial scout film demonstrates a penrose drain in the left
 upper quadrant and skin staples along the mid-abdomen. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.

 There is free passage of contrast through the esophagus and the
 esophagojejunal anastomotic site with no evidence of leak or holdup. Contrast
 flows freely into the more distal small bowel.  A final overhead image
 performed at the end of the procedure demonstrates a small amount of contrast
 in the distal esophagus, and contrast seen in distal bowel.

 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of anastomotic leak or holdup of contrast, with free flow of
 contrast into the small bowel.  Findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1282**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 343**] at

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  78-year-old male with cervical spinal stenosis, unable to undergo a
 MR due to defibrillator.

 TECHNIQUE:  Informed written consent was obtained from the patient after
 discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternative management options.  The
 risks discussed including infection, bleeding, headaches, CSF leak.

 The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology theater.  Timeout
 was performed, confirming the patient''s identity and the procedure to be
 performed.  The patient was placed on the biplane table in the prone position
 and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1%
 lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate was infiltrated into the skin and
 subcutaneous tissues of the back.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 20 gauge
 spinal needle was used to access the thecal sac at the L2/3 level.  Twelve-cc
 of Isovue-[**Age over 90 **]M was gently injected into the thecal sac with confirmation of
 placement under fluoroscopy.  After completion of the injection, the spinal
 needle was taken out and manual compression was held for hemostasis.  Multiple
 fluoroscopic views of the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spines were obtained.
 Subsequently, the patient was sent to CT for a CT myelogram.

 OPERATORS:  Doctors [**Last Name (Titles) 91**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 423**]. Tham.

 FINDINGS: A biliary stent is in place.

 LUMBAR MYELOGRAM:

 There is extrinsic narrowing of the thecal sac at the L4/5 level, which likely
 is due to disc bulge and degenerative changes of the facets and/or ligamentum
 flavum.  However, there is no high-grade stenosis or complete block of
 contrast.

 THORACIC MYELOGRAM:

 No significant stenoses are seen.

 AV FISTULOGRAM

 INDICATION:  ESRD with recently clotted right arm AV fistula, status post
 recent surgical repair.  If unable to perform thrombectomy of fistula,
 conversion of the patient''s right IJ temporary dialysis catheter to a tunneled
 catheter requested.

 Informed consent and timeout was performed prior to the  procedures.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 626**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1624**], the Attending Radiologist, present and
 supervising throughout the procedure.

 AV FISTULOGRAM:  As the large aneurysm of the AV fistula at the level of the
 right elbow was the only palpable area of the fistula, it was accessed with a
 21-gauge needle and a 3-French dilator was placed.  Gentle hand injections of
 contrast filled the large aneurysm and demonstrated some thrombus within it.
 There was only a swirling flow within the aneurysm.  No obvious outflow was
 seen.  There was a small nubbing at the superior aspect of the aneurysm, which
 may have led to the occluded portion of the fistula above the aneurysm, but
 this could not be cannulated with multiple guidewire maneuvers.

 TUNNELED DIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT:  Following local anesthesia and under
 sterile technique, a subcutaneous tunnel was created in the right
 supraclavicular area, connecting with the indwelling right IJ temporary
 dialysis catheter site.  This indwelling catheter was then exchanged over a
 guidewire for a 14.5-French introducer sheath.  A 14.5-French by 27 cm tip-to-
 cuff tunneled permanent dialysis catheter was then introduced and positioned
 with its tip in the mid right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance.  Tip
 position was documented by a fluoroscopic chest x-ray image.  The catheter was
 secured at the tunnel exit site using 0 Prolene suture.  The skin incision at
 the jugular puncture site was closed with Dermabond.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral simple fluid attenuation subdural
 collections, representing hygromas or chronic subdural hematomas.  There is no
 shift of midline structures.  The ventricles, cisterns, maintain a normal
 configuration, except for a large 4-cm cystic structure in the right
 infratentorial space that likely represents an arachnoid cyst. Periventricular
 white matter hypodensities are the sequelae of chronic small vessel
 infarction, and a lacunar infarct is present in the left external capsule. The
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  There is atherosclerotic calcification
 of the cavernous carotids.  There is partial opacification of the ethmoid
 sinuses and right sphenoid sinus.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral simple fluid attenuation frontal subdural collections
 representing hygromas or chronic subdural hematomas.  No acute hemorrhage is

 CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.

 INDICATION:  Status post fall, syncope, now with acute mental state changes.
 Evaluate for aspiration versus infiltrate.

 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting upright
 position and comparison is made with a similar preceding examination obtained
 six hours earlier.  There is no significant interval change on the single AP
 chest examinations that are submitted for comparison.  Thus, the previously
 described left-sided rather extensive pleural effusion is unchanged.  Heart
 size cannot be identified but presence of a permanent pacer with ICD device
 noted terminating in a position compatible with the apical portion of the
 right ventricle.  The accessible pulmonary lung fields do not demonstrate any
 significant pulmonary congestion, but crowded vasculature is seen in the bases
 and possibility of congestion must be entertained.  Lateral view could clearly
 identify the magnitude of pleural effusions which apparently are bilateral,
 but more marked on the left.

 HISTORY:  78-year-old male status post motor vehicle accident with neck pain,
 unable to undergo an MRI due to cardiac pacer.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 2.5-mm axial images of the cervical spine were obtained
 with coronal and sagittal reconstructions after a myelogram was performed
 under fluoroscopy.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine from [**2139-9-22**].

 Intrathecal contrast is seen extending up into the posterior fossa.

 There are large bridging anterior osteophytes extending from the C3 to the C7
 level.

 At C2/3, there is mild anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 with uncovering of the disc
 posteriorly and a small central calcified disc protrusion or osteophyte. There
 is severe left and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at this level.

 At C3/4, there is a moderate sized disk osteophyte complex which is indenting
 the left side of the cord and causing mild canal stenosis.  There is also
 moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.

 At C4/5, there is a large disk osteophyte complex more focal to the left of
 the midline, which is compressing the left side of the cervical cord and
 causing moderate to severe canal stenosis.  There is severe left neural
 foraminal narrowing also due to degenerative changes of the left uncovertebral
 joint.

 At C5/6, there is a right-sided, small disk osteophyte complex which is
 slightly indenting the right side of the cord at this level.  There is also
 moderate severe right neural foraminal narrowing.

 At C6/7, there is a central small disk osteophyte complex indenting the
 central portion of the cord.  There are degenerative changes of the
 uncovertebral joints bilaterally causing moderate bilateral neural foraminal
 narrowing.

 Calcifications of the carotid arteries and the left vertebral artery are seen.

 Again seen is a well-corticated calcifications adjacent to the spinous process
 of C7 level, which likely represents calcification of the nuchal ligament or
 old evulsion.

 There is a right IJ dual-lumen central line as well as a left-sided PICC line.

 IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine as

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT LUMBAR SPINE/MYELOGRAM

 HISTORY:  78-year-old male with back pain after motor vehicle accident, noted
 to have severe cervical spondylosis, unable to undergo an MR due to cardiac
 pacer device.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 3.75-mm axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained
 with coronal and sagittal reconstructions after a myelogram performed is at
 the fluoroscopy suite.

 FINDINGS:  Correlation is made to prior CT of the cervicothoracic spine from
 [**2139-9-22**].

 At T12/L1, there is a mild small left-sided extradural narrowing of the thecal
 sac extending from the center to the neural foramen which likely represents a
 small disc protrusion.  However, there is no canal or neural foraminal
 narrowing at this level.

 At L3/4, there is mild extrinsic narrowing of the thecal sac consistent with
 mild disc bulge and degenerative changes of the ligamentum flavum bilaterally,
 but without canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

 At L4/5, there is moderate extrinsic narrowing of the thecal sac most likely
 due to moderate disc bulge and degenerative changes of the facet joints and
 ligamentum flavum.  There is no high-grade neural foraminal narrowing.

 At L5/S1, there is mild anterior extrinsic narrowing of the thecal sac which
 likely represents mild disc bulge, but without canal or neural foraminal
 narrowing.

 There is an aneurysm of the right common iliac artery with a maximal diameter
 of approximately 1.7 cm.

 There are several patchy lucencies of the ilia bilaterally, but worse on the
 right, which are of unknown etiology.  This could be further evaluated by bone
 scan.

 A biliary drain is in place.

 IMPRESSION:  Moderate canal stenosis at L4/5 likely due to disc bulge and
 degenerative changes of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum.

 Multiple patchy lucencies of the ilia bilaterally of uncertain etiology, but
 this can be better evaluated by bone scan.

 1.7-cm aneurysm of the right common iliac artery.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall, rule out fracture.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial CT imaging of the cervical spine with
 multiplanar reformations was reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  The skull base through upper T2 levels are included in the
 imaging volume; there are no comparisons on record. There is no prevertebral
 soft tissue swelling. There is extensive degenerative disease throughout the
 cervical spine with very large bridging osteophytes from C3 through C7, marked
 disc space narrrowing and adjacent endplate degeneration, and apparent
 anterior fusion of C5 and C6. This partially limits the ability to detect
 fracture, but no fractures are identified.  There is loss of the normal
 cervical lordosis secondary to extensive degenerative changes. There is a
 small ossification posterior to the spinous process of C7.  Given the
 appearance, this likely represents sequela of remote trauma (or ligamentous
 ossification). CT evaluation of the soft tissue structures within the spinal
 canal is limited, but there is evidence of very severe spinal canal stenosis
 at multiple levels secondary to angular kyphosis at C3-4 and the very large
 posterior spondylotic ridges, with possible contribution of OPLL, present at
 C4- C5 through C6-C7 levels.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite evidence of acute injury.
 2.  Extensive multilevel degenerative changes, with degenerative angular
 kyphosis, as described, and resultant severe spinal cord compression at the
 C3-4 through C6-7 levels.
 3.  Small well corticated osseous fragment related to the C7 spinous process,
 likely old.

 COMMENT: If, given the mechanism of injury and presence of neurologic
 symptoms, there is clinical concern regarding "central cord syndrome," MR
 imaging should be considered.

 CT THORACIC SPINE.

 HISTORY:  78-year-old male with question of C6 fracture after a fall.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the thoracic spine was obtained with coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No comparisons are available.

 There is a mild compression fracture of L1 body, without paraspinal hematoma
 or retropulsion, which is of uncertain chronicity.

 There are deformities of the right transverse processes of the L1 and L2
 vertebral bodies, which may represent old fractures.

 Flowing anterior osteophytes are seen within the mid and lower thoracic spine,
 consistent with changes of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.

 There is a well circumscribed, 1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the
 anterior portion of the T5 vertebral body.  Further evaluation with bone scan

 At L3/4, there is a mild disc bulge and degenerative changes of the facet
 joints and the ligamentum flavum, which is causing mild central canal
 stenosis.

 The left kidney is absent.  In the right kidney, there is an exophytic 3.6 x 2
 cm low attenuation lesion with internal Hounsfield units of approximately 24,
 which may represent a complex cyst- confirmation of this diagnosis by
 son[**Name (NI) 899**] is recommended.

 Multiple gallstones are seen.

 There is marked dilatation of the common bile duct measuring approximately 2.3
 cm and a high density lesion measuring 2.5 cm at the pancreatic head, which
 may represent an impacted stone.  There is a biliary drain within the
 pancreatic head and extending into the duodenum.

 Extensive vascular calcifications are seen involving the aorta and its major
 branches as well as the coronary arteries.

 Pacer wires are seen within the heart.

 There is a medium to large sized left pleural effusion and a tiny right
 pleural effusion.  There are scattered punctate hyperdensities within the
 atelectatic left lower lobe, which may represent aspirated material versus
 calcified granulomas.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Mild L1 compression fracture of unknown chronicity.

 2.  1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body for which bone
 scan is recommended.

 3.  Large left pleural effusion and tiny right pleural effusion.

 Findings were provided to the ED dashboard at the time of this study.

 There is increased opacity consistent with a mass corresponding to the known
 marked thyroid enlargement in the right neck and upper mediastinum resulting
 in leftward tracheal deviation and tracheal compression at the level of
 thoracic inlet.  Increased retropharyngeal soft tissue is seen on the lateral
 view extending up into the hypopharyngeal region, also due to the known large
 thyroid mass. The anteroposterior dimension of the trachea appears normal.
 The visualized upper lung fields are clear.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  For additional details, please refer to the CT of the neck

                                 FINAL REPORT

 RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
    19.5 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2189-8-24**]);
 INDICATION: 78 you woman with esophageal cancer for staging

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 105 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the   to the   .

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:
 There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in the distal esophagous (SUVmax 4.5)
 corresponding to the area that has wall thickening on CT. The are no FDG-avid
 nodes.

 There is mild uptake in the region of the left posterior ilium where there is a
 lucency on the bone scan.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, heart and GI and GU tracts.

 The are cysts in the lungs, vascular calcifications, a left renal cyst (3.7cm
 diameter), and osteophytosis at many spinal levels.

 IMPRESSION:  1.  FDG-avid focus in the distal esophagous (SUVmax 4.5) consistent
 with esophageal cancer.  2.  No FDG-avid nodes.  3.  Focus of FDG uptake in the
 left posterior ilium of unknown etiology corresponding to a rounded lucent area
 on CT.

 INDICATION:  67-year-old male status post fall downstairs.  Not moving any
 extremities.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial imaging from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
 symphysis after administration of 130 cc  Optiray intravenous contrast.  No
 oral contrast was administered.  Multiplanar reformatted images obtained and
 reviewed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple left-sided rib
 fractures, involving ribs 1 through 6.  There is an area of pulmonary
 contusion in the left upper lobe, measuring roughly 5 x 2 cm.  There are
 scattered foci of ground glass attenuation more inferiorly in the left upper
 lobe which likely represent early areas of developing contusion.  There is a
 small left-sided hemothorax, and adjacent compressive atelectasis.  There is a
 small area of anterior mediastinal/retrosternal hematoma. There is mild
 dependent atelectasis on the right. The right lung is otherwise clear. There
 is a small bleb in the right upper lobe adjacent to the mediastinum.

 The heart and great vessels are normal.  There is no pericardial effusion. The
 thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and contour.  There is no significant
 mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube are in standard positions.  The central bronchi are patent to
 the subsegmental level.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances homogeneously.  No
 focal hepatic lesions are seen.  The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 gland, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of bowel are unremarkable.

 The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.  The right kidney is
 unremarkable.  There are few small rounded exophytic lesions off the left
 kidney, which likely represent cysts, but are too small to definitively
 characterize.  There is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic mesenteric or
 retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

 HISTORY:  Trauma.

 AP bedside chest obtained supine.  There are fractures involving the first
 seven ribs on the right with moderate displacement and associated pleural
 hemorrhage.  There is possible mediastinal widening on the right (difficult
 assessment due to supine positioning and slight rotation).  Therre is left
 pleural effusion/hemorrhage layering in supine positioning.  I doubt the
 presence of pneumothorax, although this cannot be entirely excluded.  Right
 lung clear.  NG tube lies in proximal stomach with sidehole near GE junction.
 Normally positioned ET tube.  Slightly angular lower thoracic/upper lumbar
 scoliosis may be positional but is noteworthy as regards possible spinal
 trauma.  No consolidations or vascular congestion and heart not enlarged.

 IMPRESSION:  Multiple upper left rib fractures and associated pleural
 hemorrhage/effusion.  CT scan recommended to assess mediastinum.
